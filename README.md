Big Picture

My project will be an app where when you ask it a question, it will tell you the answer. No matter the question, the app will be able to tell you the answer. You could ask it why is the sky blue and it would be able to tell you the answer. The app will have to be able to know everything in the universe and will never not know the answer. 

First Round

When you open the app it will ask you what you want to know. You enter the question and you have to wait a couple of seconds. Then it will give you your answer and it will ask you if you are happy with the answer. If you are not then it will ask you why.  It will then explain the answer it has given you and give you some possible other answers if there are any. 

Test for First Round

The question must start off with a capital letter and end with a question mark. Then you press enter and it will give you the answer for your question. If it does not have an answer, it will reply with "I do not have the answer. You have broken me. I am defeated". 

Reflections and Revisions 

My project went very well. I was able to accomplish everything I wanted to accomplish. I did not need to make really any changes to my project because everything worked out the way I wanted it to. 

Next Steps

In the next round I will like to be able to come up with the most random questions someone would ask so my program is accurate and perfect. I need to be able to come up with questions that no one would really think to ask. My answers will need to be a bit more sensitive to those who might have a different belief than myself.

Phase 2 Next Steps
What I want to do is to be able to ask a question in a seperate window, and then to get the answer in the window. There will be a search engine, and then a button to press when you enter your question. I will be using pygame to create the seperate window and then a text input in the window.
